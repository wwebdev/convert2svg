                I try to keep my website as privacy friendly as possible.
                I am using a self hosted version of <a href="https://matomo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matomo</a> for the only purpose of knowing how many people are visiting my website.

            <p><b>If you enable "Do Not Track" in your browser I won't track you</b>
                Also AdBlockers will work for blocking the tracking. I'd recomment <i>uBlock Origin</i> for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that there is nothing that could track you, as far as I'm aware of. No share links (eg. facebook)
